I'm including pretty much everything inside here.

All you have to do is install facebooker

sudo gem install facebooker

ALSO

for some reason rake doesn't like my facebooker entry inside environment.rb, so in order to run rake you'll need to comment that line out.  If you have a fix for it please send it my way.  Thanks!
